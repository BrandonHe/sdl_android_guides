## Uploading Files and Graphics
Graphics allow for you to better customize what you would like to have your users see and provide a better User Interface.

When developing an application using SmartDeviceLink, two things must always be remembered when using graphics:

1. You may be connected to a head unit that does not display graphics.
2. You must upload them from your mobile device to Core before using them.

### Detecting if Graphics are Supported
Being able to know if graphics are supported is a very important feature of your application, as this avoids you uploading unneccessary images to the head unit. In order to see if graphics are supported, use the `getDisplayCapabilities()` method of a valid `SdlProxyALM` to find out the display capabilities of the head unit.

```java
DisplayCapabilities displayCapabilities = proxy.getDisplayCapabilities();
Boolean graphicsSupported = displayCapabilities.getGraphicSupported();
```

### Uploading a File using PutFile
To upload a file to Core, use the `PutFile` RPC. You can use the RPC response callback to perform certain actions upon a successful or unsuccessful upload. Here's an example that attempts to upload an image to Core and set's the app's HMI icon upon a successful upload.

```java
PutFile putFileRequest = new PutFile();
putFileRequest.setSdlFileName("appIcon.jpeg");
putFileRequest.setFileType(FileType.GRAPHIC_JPEG);
putFileRequest.setPersistentFile(true);
putFileRequest.setFileData(file_data); // can create file_data using helper method below
putFileRequest.setCorrelationID(CorrelationIdGenerator.generateId());
putFileRequest.setOnRPCResponseListener(new OnRPCResponseListener() {

    @Override
    public void onResponse(int correlationId, RPCResponse response) {
        setListenerType(UPDATE_LISTENER_TYPE_PUT_FILE); // necessary for PutFile requests

        if(response.getSuccess()){
            try {
                proxy.setappicon("appIcon.jpeg", CorrelationIdGenerator.generateId());
            } catch (SdlException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }else{
            Log.i("SdlService", "Unsuccessful app icon upload.");
        }
    }
});
try {
    proxy.sendRPCRequest(putFileRequest);
} catch (SdlException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

App icons and other images might be hardcoded into the app and getting their raw data will be important. The following method will help get that data:

```java
/**
* Helper method to take resource files and turn them into byte arrays
* @param resource Resource file id.
* @return Resulting byte array.
*/
private byte[] contentsOfResource(int resource) {
	InputStream is = null;
	try {
		is = getResources().openRawResource(resource);
		ByteArrayOutputStream os = new ByteArrayOutputStream(is.available());
		final int bufferSize = 4096;
		final byte[] buffer = new byte[bufferSize];
		int available;
		while ((available = is.read(buffer)) >= 0) {
			os.write(buffer, 0, available);
		}
		return os.toByteArray();
	} catch (IOException e) {
		Log.w(TAG, "Can't read icon file", e);
		return null;
	} finally {
		if (is != null) {
			try {
				is.close();
			} catch (IOException e) {
				e.printStackTrace();
			}
		}
	}
}
```

### File Naming
The file name can only consist of letters (a-Z) and numbers (0-9), otherwise the SDL Core may fail to find the uploaded file (even if it was uploaded successfully).

### File Persistance
PutFile supports uploading persistant images, i.e. images that do not become deleted when your application disconnects. Persistance should be used for images relating to your UI, and not for dynamic aspects, such as Album Artwork.

This relates to the following line in the above example:
```
putFileRequest.setPersistentFile(true);
```

!!! note
Be aware that persistance will not work if space on the head unit is limited.
!!!

### Overwrite Stored Files
If a file being uploaded has the same name as an already uploaded file, the new file will overwrite the previous file. 

### Check if a File Has Already Been Uploaded
You can use the `ListFiles` RPC to check for the names of uploaded files to avoid overwriting a file.

```java
ListFiles listFiles = new ListFiles();
listFiles.setCorrelationID(CorrelationIdGenerator.generateId());
listFiles.setOnRPCResponseListener(new OnRPCResponseListener() {
    @Override
    public void onResponse(int correlationId, RPCResponse response) {
        if(response.getSuccess()){
            List<String> filenames = ((ListFilesResponse) response).getFilenames();
            if(filenames.contains("appIcon.jpeg")){
                Log.i("SdlService", "App icon is already uploaded.");
            }else{
                Log.i("SdlService", "App icon has not been uploaded.");
            }
        }else{
            Log.i("SdlService", "Failed to request list of uploaded files.");
        }
    }
});
try{
	proxy.sendRPCRequest(listFiles);
} catch (SdlException e) {
	e.printStackTrace();
}
```

### Check the Amount of File Storage
To find the amount of file storage left on the head unit, use the  the `ListFiles` RPC in a similar fashion.

```java
ListFiles listFiles = new ListFiles();
listFiles.setCorrelationID(CorrelationIdGenerator.generateId());
listFiles.setOnRPCResponseListener(new OnRPCResponseListener() {
    @Override
    public void onResponse(int correlationId, RPCResponse response) {
        if(response.getSuccess()){
            Integer spaceAvailable = ((ListFilesResponse) response).getSpaceAvailable();
            Log.i("SdlService", "Space available on Core = " + spaceAvailable);
        }else{
            Log.i("SdlService", "Failed to request list of uploaded files.");
        }
    }
});
try{
	proxy.sendRPCRequest(listFiles);
} catch (SdlException e) {
	e.printStackTrace();
}
```

### Delete Stored Files
Use the `DeleteFile` RPC to delete a file associated with a file name.

```java
DeleteFile deleteFileRequest = new DeleteFile();
deleteFileRequest.setSdlFileName("appIcon.jpeg");
deleteFileRequest.setCorrelationID(CorrelationIdGenerator.generateId());
deleteFileRequest.setOnRPCResponseListener(new OnRPCResponseListener() {

    @Override
    public void onResponse(int correlationId, RPCResponse response) {
        if(response.getSuccess()){
            Log.i("SdlService", "App icon deleted.");
        }else{
            Log.i("SdlService", "Unable to delete app icon.");
        }
    }
});
try{
	proxy.sendRPCRequest(deleteFileRequest);
} catch (SdlException e) {
	e.printStackTrace();
}
```

## Image Specifics
### Image File Type
Images may be formatted as PNG, JPEG, or BMP. Check the `DisplayCapabilities` object provided by your `SdlProxyALM` to find out what image formats the head unit supports.

### Image Sizes
If an image is uploaded that is larger than the supported size, that image will be scaled down to accomodate.
