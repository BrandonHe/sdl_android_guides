# PerformInteraction

Performs an application-initiated interaction in which the user can select a Choice from among the specified Choice Sets. For instance, an application may use a PerformInteraction to ask a user to say the name of a song to play. The user's response is only valid if it appears in the specified Choice Sets and is recognized by SDL.

### HMI Status Requirements ###

### Response ###

Indicates that interaction is complete, or was rejected.
An interaction can complete when the user selects a choice, or when the interaction times out (no user selection was made), or when the interaction was interrupted by the user (pressing PTT or Menu button), or by system events (e.g. phone call), etc.
This is sent to the mobile application after the user makes a choice from the PerformInteraction Request; or if the user fails to make a selection and the Request times out. Two additional parameters, cmdID and triggerSource, are provided with this Response. The cmdID parameter represents the ID of the Choice in the InteractionChoices that was selected by the user. The triggerSource parameter indicates where said Choice selection came from (either Menu or VR).
