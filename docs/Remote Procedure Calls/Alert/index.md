# Alert

Provides information to the user using either TTS, the Display or both and can include a system-generated alert tone.

  - The displayed portion of the Alert, if any, will persist until the specified timeout has elapsed, or the Alert is preempted.
  - An Alert will preempt (abort) any smartdevicelink Operation that is in-progress, except an already-in-progress Alert.
  - An Alert cannot be preempted by any smartdevicelink Operation.
  - An Alert can be preempted by a user action (button push).
  - An Alert will fail if it is issued while another Alert is in progress. Assuming it's coming from the same app, the current Alert gets ABORTED and the new Alert will get displayed/audible.
 - Although each Alert parameter is optional, in fact each Alert request must supply at least one of the following **parameters:**
 - alertText1
- alertText2
- alertText3
-	ttsChunks

### HMI Status Requirements ###

HMILevel needs to be FULL or LIMITED.

If the app has been granted function group Notification the HMILevel can also be BACKGROUND
