# RegisterAppInterface
Registers the application's interface with SDL, declaring properties of the registration, including the messaging interface version, the app name, etc. The mobile application must establish its interface registration with SDL before any other interaction with SDL can take place. The registration lasts until it is terminated either by the application calling the UnregisterAppInterface method, or by SDL sending an OnAppInterfaceUnregistered notification, or by loss of the underlying transport connection, or closing of the underlying message transmission protocol RPC session.

Until the application receives its first OnHMIStatus Notification, its HMI Status is assumed to be: `HMILevel=NONE`, `AudioStreamingState=NOT_AUDIBLE`, `SystemContext=MAIN`.

All SDL resources which the application creates or uses (e.g. Choice Sets, Command Menu, etc.) are associated with the application's interface registration. Therefore, when the interface registration ends, the SDL resources associated with the application are disposed of. As a result, even though the application itself may continue to run on its host platform (e.g. mobile device) after the interface registration terminates, the application will not be able to use the SDL HMI without first establishing a new interface registration and re-creating its required SDL resources. That is, SDL resources created by (or on behalf of) an application do not persist beyond the life span of the interface registration.

Resources and settings whose lifespan is tied to the duration of an application's interface registration:
- 	Choice Sets
- Command Menus (built by successive calls to AddCommand)
-	Media clock timer display value
- Media track display value
- Button subscriptions

The autoActivateID is used to grant an application the HMILevel and AudioStreamingState it had when it last disconnected.

**Note:** The autoActivateID parameter, and associated behavior, is currently ignored by SDL.

When first calling this method (i.e. first time within life cycle of mobile app), an autoActivateID should not be included. After successfully registering an interface, an autoActivateID is returned to the mobile application for it to use in subsequent connections. If the connection between SDL and the mobile application is lost, such as the vehicle is turned off while the application is running, the autoActivateID can then be passed in another call to RegisterAppInterface to re-acquire HMILevel=FULL.

If the application intends to stream audio it is important to indicate so via the isMediaApp parameter. When set to true, audio will reliably stream without any configuration required by the user. When not set, audio may stream, depending on what the user might have manually configured as a media source on SDLÂ®.

There is no time limit for how long the autoActivateID is "valid" (i.e. would confer focus and opt-in)

### HMI Status Requirements ###

HMILevel is not defined before registering.

### Response ###
The response message contains essential information about the SDL system that the request was sent to. This information can be used by an application to alter functionality depending on which type of SDL system it is running on. For instance, an application can use the displayCapabilities parameter to see whether the SDL HMI offers a touch screen, a two-line display, or a one-line display.

The application could then use that information to make sure that the text written to the screen is readable for the given platform. If a resultCode other than SUCCESS is received, the application will have to send one or more RegisterAppInterface Requests until one has a result code of SUCCESS; otherwise, the application is not permitted to send any other Requests.

### Non-default Result Codes: ###
```xml
- SUCCESS
- INVALID_DATA
- OUT_OF_MEMORY
- TOO_MANY_PENDING_REQUESTS
- GENERIC_ERROR
- DUPLICATE_NAME
- TOO_MANY_APPLICATIONS
- APPLICATION_REGISTERED_ALREADY
- UNSUPPORTED_VERSION
- WRONG_LANGUAGE
- DISALLOWED
