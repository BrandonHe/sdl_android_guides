## Supporting Haptic Input

SDL now supports "haptic" input, input from something other than a touch screen. This could include trackpads, click-wheels, etc. These kinds of inputs work by knowing which areas on the screen are touchable and focusing on those areas when the user moves the trackpad or click wheel. When the user selects a rect, the center of that area will be "touched".

!!! Note
Currently, there are no RPCs for knowing which rect is highlighted, so your UI will have to remain static, without scrolling. 
!!!

You will also need to implement touch input support (Mobile Navigation/Touch Input) in order to receive touches of the rects.

### Using SDL Presentation

SDL has support for automatically detecting focusable rects within your UI and sending that data to the head unit. You will still need to tell SDL when your UI changes so that it can re-scan and detect the rects to be sent. The easiest way to use this is by taking advantage of SDL's Presentation class. This will automatically check if the capability is available and instantiate the manager for you. All you have to do is set your layout:

```java
	public static class MyPresentation extends SdlRemoteDisplay{

		public MyPresentation(Context context, Display display) {
			super(context, display);
		}

		@Override
		protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
			super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
			setContentView(R.layout.haptic_layout);
			LinearLayout videoView = (LinearLayout) findViewById(R.id.cat_view);
			videoView.setOnTouchListener(new View.OnTouchListener() {
                @Override
                public boolean onTouch(View v, MotionEvent event) {
                    // ...Update something on the ui
					MyPresentation.this.invalidate()
                }
            });
		}
	}
```

This will go through your view that was passed in and then find and send the rects to the head unit for use. When your UI changes, call `invalidate()` from your class that extends SdlRemoteDisplay;

### Sending your own Rects

It is also possible that you may want to create your own rects instead of using the automated methods in the Presentation class. It is important that if sending this data youself that you also use the `SystemCapabilityManager` to check if you are on a head unit that supports this feature. If the capability is available, it is easy to build the area you want to become selectable:

```java
    public void sendHapticData() {

		Rectangle rectangle = new Rectangle();
		rectangle.setX((float) 1.0);
		rectangle.setY((float) 1.0);
		rectangle.setWidth((float) 1.0);
		rectangle.setHeight((float) 1.0);

		HapticRect hapticRect = new HapticRect();
		hapticRect.setId(123);
		hapticRect.setRect(rec);

		ArrayList<HapticRect> hapticArray = new ArrayList<HapticRect>();
		hapticArray.add(0,hr);

		SendHapticData sendHapticData = new SendHapticData();
		sendHapticData.setHapticRectData(hapticArray);

		try {
			proxy.sendRPCRequest(sendHapticData);
		} catch (SdlException e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
	}
```

Each SendHapticData rpc should contain the entirety of all clickable areas to be accessed via haptic controls.
