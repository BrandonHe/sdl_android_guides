## Get Vehicle Data

Use the GetVehicleData RPC request to get vehicle data. The HMI level must be FULL, LIMITED, or BACKGROUND in order to get data.

Each vehicle manufacturer decides which data it will expose. Please check the `OnPermissionsChange` RPC notification to find out which data you will have access to in your head unit.

!!! note
You may only ask for vehicle data that is available to your appName & appId combination. These will be specified by each OEM separately.

### Single Time Vehicle Data Retrieval
Using `GetVehicleData`, we can ask for vehicle data a single time, if needed. 

```java
GetVehicleData vdRequest = new GetVehicleData();
vdRequest.setPrndl(true);
vdRequest.setOnRPCResponseListener(new OnRPCResponseListener() {
	@Override
	public void onResponse(int correlationId, RPCResponse response) {
		if(response.getSuccess()){
			PRNDL prndl = ((GetVehicleDataResponse) response).getPrndl();
			Log.i("SdlService", "PRNDL status: " + prndl.toString());
		}else{
			Log.i("SdlService", "GetVehicleData was rejected.");
		}
	}
});
try {
	proxy.sendRPCRequest(vdRequest);
} catch (SdlException e) {
	e.printStackTrace();
}
```

### Subscribing to Vehicle Data
Subscribing to vehicle data allows you to get notified whenever we have new data available. This data should not be relied upon being received in a consistent manner. New vehicle data is available roughly every second.

**First**, send the Subscribe Vehicle Data Request

```java
SubscribeVehicleData subscribeRequest = new SubscribeVehicleData();
subscribeRequest.setPrndl(true);
subscribeRequest.setOnRPCResponseListener(new OnRPCResponseListener() {
    @Override
    public void onResponse(int correlationId, RPCResponse response) {
        if(response.getSuccess()){
            Log.i("SdlService", "Successfully subscribed to vehicle data.");
        }else{
            Log.i("SdlService", "Request to subscribe to vehicle data was rejected.");
        }
    }
});
    
try {
    proxy.sendRPCRequest(subscribeRequest);
} catch (SdlException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

**Then**, you'll be able to observe the new data in the `OnVehicleData` notification: 

```java
@Override
public void onOnVehicleData(OnVehicleData notification) {
	PRNDL prndl = notification.getPrndl();
	Log.i("SdlService", "PRNDL status was updated to: " prndl.toString());
}
```

### Unsubscribing from Vehicle Data
Sometimes you may not always need all of the vehicle data you are listening to. We suggest that you only are subscribing when the vehicle data is needed. To stop listening to specific vehicle data items, utilize `UnsubscribeVehicleData`.

```java
UnsubscribeVehicleData unsubscribeRequest = new UnsubscribeVehicleData();
unsubscribeRequest.setPrndl(true); // unsubscribe to PRNDL data
unsubscribeRequest.setOnRPCResponseListener(new OnRPCResponseListener() {
    @Override
    public void onResponse(int correlationId, RPCResponse response) {
        if(response.getSuccess()){
            Log.i("SdlService", "Successfully unsubscribed to vehicle data.");
        }else{
            Log.i("SdlService", "Request to unsubscribe to vehicle data was rejected.");
        }
    }
});
	
try {
    proxy.sendRPCRequest(unsubscribeRequest);
} catch (SdlException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```
